Collabzone1 projects
in this collaboration lets focus on data and time data and time what i want to collaborate on is creating a app that takes in data and moves it around durring time the data could be shaped as 
dots change colors once the data has changed 1 example employee at a job and one of his main duties have been taken from automation so in the simulation this dot will be blue then once automation takes
the job it turns red 

will edit in the morning read the chat gpt for more details
